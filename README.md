# PRODIGY_CS_01
This repository contains the information for the task that I have completed for my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Task 1: Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

I have used VSCode and Python programming language to run the program.
